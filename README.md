# SimpleChartWithDjango
A Django app that shows timeseries data using data source

It has a navbar that can be used to switch between pages.

The page itself is simple, it just has a chart and a dropdown menu to select the time period (like last 10 days/month/year etc)
The chart shows time series data (eg via line graph)

The data is stored in data source (candidate - mongodb) and is passed to frontend via json payload

Add unit test (optional, since this is boilerplate/starter)
